Key Functional Requirements:
1. High-fidelity audio playback & low-latency streaming (< 200ms time-to-first-byte).
2. Song catalog browsing, search by artist/album/track, and personalized playlist curation.
3. User subscription models (Free ad-supported vs Premium 320kbps lossless streaming).
4. Offline download playback with DRM authorization tokens.

Scale & Capacity Estimation:
- 500M Monthly Active Users (MAU), 100M Daily Active Users (DAU).
- Audio library of 100M songs with average size of 5MB per track = ~500TB storage.
- Peak streaming bandwidth: 100M concurrent streams * 160 kbps avg bitrate = ~16 Tbps outbound throughput.

Core High-Level Architecture:
- Client (Mobile/Desktop/Web): Manages local audio ring buffer, audio playback state, and local chunk cache (LRU).
- CDN & Edge Network (Cloudflare/CloudFront/Fastly): Caches encrypted audio chunks (e.g. 5-10 second segment chunks encoded in Ogg Vorbis / AAC) at edge PoPs closest to users.
- API Gateway & Reverse Proxy (Envoy/Kong): Terminates TLS, verifies JWT access tokens, performs rate limiting, and routes API requests.
- Audio Ingestion & Transcoding Pipeline: Asynchronous queue (Kafka + Celery workers) that takes master WAV/FLAC audio files from record labels, normalizes volume (ReplayGain), transcodes into multi-bitrate streams (96kbps, 160kbps, 320kbps), splits into chunked byte ranges, and stores raw objects in Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage.
- Metadata & Catalog Service: High-throughput microservice backed by PostgreSQL / Amazon Aurora (for relational artist-album-track hierarchy) with a Redis distributed caching tier for top tracks and artist profiles.
- Search Service: Powered by Elasticsearch / OpenSearch cluster with inverted index on song titles, artists, and lyrics with n-gram fuzzy matching and auto-complete.
- Recommendation & Playlist Engine: Graph DB (Neo4j) / Vector DB (Pinecone/Milvus) with collaborative filtering and real-time Kafka event streams feeding Apache Flink / Spark for Discover Weekly and personalized radio.
- User Library & Playlist Storage: Distributed NoSQL database (Apache Cassandra / ScyllaDB) partitioned by user_id for fast read/write of custom playlists.

Reliability, Caching & Resilience:
- Tiered Caching: Edge CDN caching for popular 20% tracks (Pareto 80/20 rule), Regional Origin Shielding, and Redis in-memory cache for user sessions and playlists.
- Stream Optimization: Range header HTTP requests (Range: bytes=0-1048576) allowing clients to fetch the first 1MB instantly to start playback while streaming the remainder in the background.`;

- Storage: Blob storage (Google Cloud Storage / AWS S3) for video chunks; Cassandra / Bigtable for video metadata, comments, and view counts.
